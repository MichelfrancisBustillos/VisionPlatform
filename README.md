## Description
  
  Object tracking system with Raspberry Pi based vision processing (for object recognition) and ESP32 based pan and tilt camera mount.
  The ultimate goal is to design a system that can identify a 'target' (specific person or object) and track it within the systems range of mobility. This project is an attempt to incorporate various hardware and software technologies into a single system that has practical applications.
  **This is the Raspberry Pi/Python portion of this project. The other half can be found at [MichelfrancisBustillos/MotionPlatform](https://github.com/MichelfrancisBustillos/MotionPlatform).**
